# Anime Tracker - Development Context & Current Status

## üéØ Project Goal

Building a **clean, mobile-first anime tracking application** as a portfolio project to showcase modern React development skills. The app fills the gap between overly complex trackers (like AniList) and basic apps that aren't visually engaging.

**Target:** Anime fans who want simple, beautiful tracking without social features or overwhelming interfaces.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first, mobile-first responsive design)
- **API:** Jikan API (MyAnimeList data, no auth required)
- **Storage:** localStorage (Phase 1) ‚Üí Cloud backend (Phase 2)
- **Routing:** React Router DOM

## ‚úÖ What's Been Accomplished

### Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETE

- Full React + TypeScript + Tailwind setup with Vite
- Professional component architecture with clean separation
- Complete localStorage service layer with error handling
- Real Jikan API integration for anime search
- Mobile-first responsive design with bottom navigation

### Working Features ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL

- **Search:** Real-time anime search with Jikan API
- **Add to List:** Users can save anime to personal collection
- **My List Management:** View saved anime, change watch status, remove entries
- **Status Management:** Complete dropdown system for tracking progress (watching, completed, plan-to-watch, etc.)
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bars showing episode completion for anime with known totals
- **Episode Progress:** Text indicators for ongoing anime without known episode counts
- **Responsive Design:** Works beautifully on mobile and desktop
- **Data Persistence:** All changes save to localStorage and survive browser sessions

### Component Architecture ‚úÖ PROFESSIONAL
