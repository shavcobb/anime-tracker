Anime Tracker - Project Context & Documentation
🎯 Project Overview
What: A clean, mobile-first anime tracking application
Goal: Portfolio project showcasing React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS skills
Target Users: Anime fans who want simple, beautiful tracking without social features
Differentiator: Customizable interface, beginner-friendly, distraction-free
❓ Problem Statement
Existing anime trackers are either:

Too complex (AniList - overwhelming for new users despite being well-designed)
Too simple (basic apps - not visually engaging)
Feature-heavy (social features, forums, reviews when users just want tracking)

Our Solution: "What if someone just wants a beautiful, simple way to track anime without all the extra features?"
🏗️ Technical Architecture
Tech Stack

Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
Styling: Tailwind CSS (learning this for job market)
Routing: React Router DOM
API: Jikan API (unofficial MyAnimeList API - free, no auth required)
State: Local Storage (Phase 1) → Backend (Phase 2)
Deployment: Vercel/Netlify

Conditional buttons (Add vs Remove based on context)

🔧 API & Data Management
Jikan API Integration ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Base URL: https://api.jikan.moe/v4
Rate Limits: 30 requests/minute, 2 requests/second
No Auth Required: Free to use
Key Endpoints:

Search: /anime?q={query} ✅ WORKING
Details: /anime/{id} (planned for anime detail pages)



Local Storage System ✅ COMPLETE

Full CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete anime entries
Error Handling: Try-catch blocks for JSON parsing and storage operations
Type Safety: Complete TypeScript integration
Data Persistence: Survives browser sessions and refreshes

Data Flow ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Search: User searches → Jikan API → Display real anime results
Add to List: User clicks add → Store in localStorage with full UserAnimeEntry
View List: Load from localStorage → Display user's saved anime
Remove from List: User clicks remove → Update localStorage → Refresh display
Update Progress: Ready for implementation (edit functionality)

TypeScript Types ✅ COMPLETE

JikanAnime: Raw API response structure
Anime: Simplified app data structure
UserAnimeEntry: User's tracking data + anime info
WatchStatus: 'watching' | 'completed' | 'plan-to-watch' | 'dropped' | 'on-hold'
