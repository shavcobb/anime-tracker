## 💡 Inspiration

As someone who’s used MyAnimeList for years but found it visually overwhelming, and tried simpler alternatives that lacked engagement, I wanted to create something that captures the best of both worlds. This project combines my background in psychology-informed UX design with modern front-end development practices.
