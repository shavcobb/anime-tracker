# Tsugi - Anime Tracker

A beautiful, customizable anime tracking application that bridges the gap between complex platforms and overly simple trackers. Built for both anime newcomers and seasoned fans who want a clean, engaging way to manage their watchlists.

## Why This Project?

## Inspiration

As someone who’s used MyAnimeList for years but found it visually overwhelming, and tried simpler alternatives that lacked engagement, I wanted to create something that captures the best of both worlds. This project combines my background in psychology-informed UX design with modern front-end development practices.
